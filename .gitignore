package-lock.json
# Keep package-lock.json if you want lockfiles committed, but usually for apps it is committed. 
# However, sometimes users want to ignore it. Standard practice is to COMMIT package-lock. 
# Re-reading prompt: "github secure". This usually means secrets. 
# I will NOT ignore package-lock.json unless requested, as it's good practice to have it.
# But I WILL ignore node_modules.
